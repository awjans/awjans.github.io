Ingenious Partners, LLC is a website that I built for my own company. The project helped me learn how to design and implement a responsive website.

Vacay is implemented using [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), a PHP application platform.

In this project I gained experience with front-end web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming. 

Here is some example code to illustrate Simple Schema use:
