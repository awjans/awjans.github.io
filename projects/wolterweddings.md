Wolter Weddings is a website that I built for my Pastor. He wanted a site that would attract LGBTQ+ people that were looking to get married here on Oahu. The project helped me learn how to design and implement a reactive website.

Wolter Weddings is a modern one-page website that allows users to collapse sections. The collapsing mechanism was implemented using Javascript and CSS. I regret that I did not use a framework like React.js instead of hand-coding the reactions.
