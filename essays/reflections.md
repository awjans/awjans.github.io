*Reflection: a thought, idea, or opinion formed or a remark made as a result of meditation.*<sup>1</sup>

I had a love/hate relationship with Javascript. Mainly because most of my experience with the language was pre-ES5. There were no Node.js or React.js frameworks to make life easier. I did love it for automation as a substitute for VBScript under Windows, but then Powershell came out.

After going through the exercise of updating my skills using CodeAcademy and FreeCodeCamp, I might just be loving it again. And coupled with the Meteor tutorial, which gave me some insights into Node.js and React.js, I could see myself using Javascript as my main language.

I am especially intrigued by promises and asynchronous execution. That feature has always proved difficult to properly code in other languages like C#. Given my interest in multithreading and asynchronous coding, Javascript may yet prove to be a solution for that as well.

When I first heard "Athletic Software Engineering", I had visions of trying to code while running or lifting weights. I was happy it just meant being timed. But then again, I have issues with being timed. I never could memorize my times table and say it in under two minutes back in elementary school.

Javascript has changed a lot over the years. The frameworks that support reactive behavior in the browser have made huge strides. And Athletic Software engineering could be the best way to hammer home the power of the language.
