<p>Rug weaving, a delicate and intricate craft, shares a curious similarity with the realm of software development. Just as a master rug weaver imparts the art of weaving through patterns to an apprentice, software developers employ design patterns to
create robust, scalable, and maintainable code. This essay explores the concept of design patterns in software development, drawing a parallel with the art of rug weaving, and delves into personal experiences with these patterns.</p>

<h2 id="rug-weaving-101-understanding-design-patterns">Rug Weaving 101: Understanding Design Patterns</h2>

<p>When a master rug weaver teaches an apprentice, the emphasis is not solely on the act of weaving a rug but on weaving patterns. These patterns serve as a crucial tool, facilitating communication of the intricate design from the master to the
apprentice. Through mastering these patterns, the apprentice not only learns the craft but gains the ability to create their own unique rugs. Furthermore, this knowledge is passed down through generations as each adept apprentice becomes a master
weaver in their own right, perpetuating the artistry.</p>

<p>In the realm of software development, design patterns play a similar role. They are recurring solutions to common problems faced by developers during the design and implementation of software systems. Like the rug weaving patterns, design patterns
act as a bridge of communication between experienced developers and those just entering the field. They provide a shared vocabulary and set of best practices that enable effective collaboration and the creation of software that is not only functional
but also well-structured and maintainable.</p>

<p>Design patterns are not boilerplate code but rather high-level concepts that can be adapted and implemented in various ways to address specific challenges. They encapsulate solutions to common design problems and promote code reuse, flexibility, and
readability. By understanding and employing these patterns, developers can enhance the quality of their code and contribute to the overall efficiency of the development process.</p>

<h2 id="patterns-in-the-code-personal-experiences">Patterns in the Code: Personal Experiences</h2>

<p>Reflecting on my own experiences as a software developer, I’ve encountered and applied several design patterns to solve complex problems and improve the architecture of software projects.</p>

<p><strong>Singleton Pattern:</strong>
In various projects, I’ve employed the Singleton pattern to ensure the existence of a single instance of a class. This pattern has been particularly useful when managing global resources such as configuration settings, logging mechanisms, or database
connections. Much like the single point of access in rug weaving patterns, the Singleton pattern provides a centralized way to control and coordinate certain aspects of the application.</p>

<p><strong>Observer Pattern:</strong>
In scenarios where one part of the system needed to be notified of changes in another, I’ve utilized the Observer pattern. Drawing inspiration from the interconnectedness in rug weaving patterns, this pattern establishes a relationship where one
object (the subject) maintains a list of dependents (observers) that are notified of any state changes. This has proven effective in building responsive and loosely-coupled systems.</p>

<p><strong>Factory Method Pattern:</strong>
When the type of object to be created is determined at runtime, I’ve turned to the Factory Method pattern. Much like the flexibility inherent in rug weaving patterns, this design pattern allows the creation of objects without specifying their exact
class, promoting code extensibility and adaptability.</p>

<p>In conclusion, design patterns are the threads that weave together the fabric of well-designed and maintainable software. By drawing parallels with the art of rug weaving, we can appreciate the significance of these patterns in facilitating
communication, passing down knowledge, and creating enduring masterpieces. As we continue to refine our craft in software development, embracing and mastering design patterns ensures that, like skilled rug weavers, we leave behind a legacy of
well-crafted and adaptable code for future generations of developers.</p>

<p><em>This essay was written with the help of ChatGPT and GitHub Co-Pilot. It is a reflection on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the ICS 314 Software Engineering course. The analogy between rug weavers and software engineers was my original
idea.</em></p>
