## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence is a wondrous tool. It can be used to create art, music, and literature. But at the heart, it is not intelligent, it is not creative, it is a hazy reflection of humanity. I do not think that AI is a good tool for software
engineering, and I do not think that it will be for a while.

## Personal Experience with AI

I toyed with Co-Pilot at the start of the semester when I got my GitHub Student pass, and I tried ChatGPT at the behest of my ICS 314 Software Engineering professor. I found them lacking in the ability to create something new, something that I could
not have done myself. They did not read my mind, and if I could not fully explain what I wanted, they could not help me. More often then not, when I did try them, I found that they were not generating the code that I wanted.

I am giving Co-Pilot another try with the Final Project. But I have found that unless there is sufficient code to train it on, it is not very useful. I have also found that is generates a lot of words that are redundant when creating documentation.
Very rarely does it generate something that is useful.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding

I do not think that AI has had any impact on my learning and understanding. If I did not have the experience I do, I would not be able to tell when it is giving me garbage or gold. The problems I had in the Workout of the Day (WOD) exercises were
ones I could not explain what my problem was, so how could I get help from an AI? 

## Practical Applications

The best use that I have found for AI is to spot patterns in medical images that diagnose disease or injury faster and sooner than a human doctor. I heard of one case, however, were the AI was trained on images from a hospital that had a rulers in
the images to help with scale where the disease was present. The AI was therefore trained to flag images with a ruler as being diseased.

## Challenges and Opportunities

The challenges that I have had were those that I could not explain to the AI what is was that I needed. Especially in the timed environments of the WODs. I did not feel that I could explain to the AI what I needed in the time allotted, and have time
left to fix what the AI got wrong.

## Comparative Analysis

We experienced an AI-enhanced approach to learning about software engineering? I don't think the students who used AI-enhanced learning learned anything about software engineering. They learned how to use an AI, but not how to do write software.

## Future Considerations

A lot of what I have learned over the years, besides writing elegant code, is how to do repetitive tasks quickly and efficiently. But Co-Pilot seems to only look at the current file, and does not look at the project as a whole. I think that if it
could do that, and help me apply the pattern from one file to another, it would be more useful. I harken back to the code generators of the 90s, that took a description of what you wanted, and generated the code for you. I think that is the future of
AI in software engineering, but we are not there yet.

## Conclusion

AI has a long way to go before it is useful for novice software engineers. Too often, it generates code that is not useful, or is redundant. It cannot be trusted to give the right answer to someone that is not experienced enough to know when it is
wrong. Also, what do you learn when the answer is given to you? You learn how to use the tool, but not how to do the work. I don't have any suggestions for optimizing the integration of AI in future courses, because I don't think it is a good idea.
